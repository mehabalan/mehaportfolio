  <!-- Biography Story -->
  <section class="bio-section">
    <h2>👶 Childhood & Early Life</h2>
    <p>
      Mehabalan, the youngest son of Sethuraja and Sasikala, was born in Thamaraikulam, a growing village in Ramanathapuram, Tamil Nadu. 
      Loved deeply by his elder brothers, Manobalan and Vinobalan, he grew up in a close-knit farmer family. 
      <br><br>
      Unlike most kids his age, life lessons for Mehabalan came outside classrooms. By 5th standard, he was confidently driving cars, bikes, 
      and even heavy transport vehicles—skills far beyond his years. Farming, plumbing, and basic electrical work were everyday learnings, 
      shaping his problem-solving mindset early in life.

    <h2>🎥 The Creative Spark – YouTube in 2018</h2>
    <p>
      In 2018, while still in school, Mehabalan explored his creative side by starting a 
      <a href="https://youtube.com/@mehabalan?si=vSlH_YIodhEE9T8W" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>. 
      Shooting, editing, and posting—all done by himself—he documented random moments and vlogs. 
      Though not consistent, it revealed his independent and creative nature.

    <h2>🎓 College Life – The Wanderer</h2>
    <p>
      In 2020, he joined RVS College of Engineering, Coimbatore, pursuing Computer Science and Engineering. 
      But he wasn’t the typical studious college kid—he wandered through Coimbatore, Tirupur, and Erode, 
      enjoying life more than lectures. 
      <br><br>
      His carefree attitude led to 6 arrears. But in his final semester, he shocked everyone by clearing 11 papers 
      in a single attempt, proving his quick learning ability when focused. This was his first major comeback.

    <h2>🌍 Bangalore – Lost in Translation, Quick in Adaptation</h2>
    <p>
      After graduation, Mehabalan moved to Bangalore in search of opportunities. On his first day, he couldn’t understand a word of Kannada—
      even the bus conductor’s words felt like an unknown world. 
      <br><br>
      But within 15 days, he learned 80% of Kannada—enough to understand and speak confidently, even with small grammar mistakes. 
      His Kannada-speaking roommate admired his speed of learning.
      <br><br>
      During this time, he self-studied Core Java, showing once again his ability to learn complex skills on his own.

    <h2>💼 Job Struggles, Yet Happiness</h2>
    <p>
      Like many freshers, Mehabalan faced the classic dilemma: *“Everyone wants experience before giving you a job, but how to get 
      experience without a job?”* 
      <br><br>
      For six months, he attended countless interviews but faced rejections. Yet, he embraced Bangalore’s climate, made friends, 
      and continued vlogging, capturing the beauty of life even without a job.

  <section class="bio-section">
    <h2>🏙️ Chennai – The Breakthrough</h2>
    <p>
      After six months in Bangalore, he moved to Chennai for a fresh start. Here, he finally got his break—joining IT industry 
      as a QA Intern. 
      <br><br>
      From there, he grew into a **Software Tester and QA Analyst**, mastering Manual and Automation Testing for web and mobile apps, 
      API testing, and advanced QA methodologies.
